  <h1>Licensing/Terms of Use</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAMPUS DIGITAL REPOSITORY TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING ONELINK'S SERVICES.</p>
  
    <p>These terms govern your access to and use of OneLink, Inc. Digital Repository.</p>
  
    <p>These terms in no way alter your OneLink End User License Agreement.</p>
    <p>These Terms describe the obligations of users of the Service.</p>
  
    <p>For other portions of our software that you have licensed, your OneLink EULA terms remain unchanged.</p>
  
    <p>Use of the Service provided is optional, and these terms help prevent the potential for misuse.</p>
  
    <p>If your EULA is terminated, your right to access the Service is also terminated.</p>
  
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree to these terms, you are not permitted to use the Service.</p>
  
    <p>Do not place content in or download content from the Campus Digital Repository.</p>
  
    <p>By agreeing to these terms, you are agreeing to these Terms both for yourself and for your organization and represent that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms.</p>
  
    <p>You may use the Service only in compliance with these terms and the OneLink EULA, which is entered separately.</p>
  
    <p>You may enable the use of the Service only if you have the power to form a contract with OneLink and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so.</p>
  
    <p>These terms may change from time to time.</p>
    <p>Your continued use of the Service after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.</p>
